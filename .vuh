# This is version update helper config.
# It contains specific to current project variables. With use of this file vuh understands how to extract project's
# version and where project's version variable is located. Vuh can't work with any project without this file!
# If .vuh file located in comparing branch is different from local .vuh file vuh will by default take
# configuration files from handling branches (f.e. local .vuh to work with local version and origin/main:.vuh
# to work with origin/main's version). If your project dont have .vuh file in project's root folder vuh will advice
# you to configure that project.
